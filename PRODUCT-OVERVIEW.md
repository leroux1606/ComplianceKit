# ComplianceKit - Product Overview

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 16, 2026

---

## What is ComplianceKit?

ComplianceKit is a comprehensive **GDPR Compliance SaaS Platform** that helps website owners, businesses, and organizations achieve and maintain compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other privacy regulations.

Think of ComplianceKit as your **automated compliance officer** - it scans your website, identifies compliance gaps, generates required legal documents, manages user consent, and helps you handle data subject requests - all from one centralized dashboard.

---

## The Problem We Solve

### Challenges Businesses Face:

1. **GDPR is Complex**: 99 articles, hundreds of pages of regulations, constantly evolving interpretations
2. **Legal Costs are High**: Hiring lawyers to draft privacy policies costs $5,000-$15,000+
3. **Technical Implementation is Difficult**: Cookie consent banners, data export systems, DSAR workflows
4. **Compliance is Time-Consuming**: Manual audits, tracking consent, responding to data requests
5. **Non-Compliance is Expensive**: GDPR fines up to €20 million or 4% of global revenue
6. **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regulations change, new tracking scripts get added, policies need updates

### Our Solution:

ComplianceKit automates 90% of GDPR compliance work, reduces compliance costs by 80%, and ensures your website stays compliant with ongoing monitoring and updates.

This app was built primarily with Claude Opus 4.5 — preserve its code style, naming conventions, error handling patterns, and Supabase usage.

ALWAYS follow these Supabase guidelines:
- Handle Supabase auth securely: Never expose service_role or anon keys in client code; always validate sessions and use RLS.
- Add logging/retries on Supabase calls: Wrap calls with try/except, add retries for transient errors (e.g., network timeouts), log errors meaningfully (e.g., with context like user ID or query details).
- Prefer minimal changes to fix bugs without altering working logic.
- For realtime: Use async subscriptions where appropriate and clean up on unmount.

Security priorities: Enforce row-level security (RLS), validate all inputs, log compliance-relevant actions.
